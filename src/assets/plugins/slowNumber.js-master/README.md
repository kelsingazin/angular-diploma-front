# slowNumber.js
Simplest and fastest way of animating your numbers.

## Why it is a good option

### Zero dependencies
You don't need to worry about security issues or any other complexity other than making your numbers change as slow as you want.

### Animate any number
 - Content
 - SVG properties
 - CSS properties

### Extremely light
Just a couple of bytes. Yes, bytes.

### Low level control
You can set how much frames per second your animation will have.

### As performative as possible
Focusing on fps, it doesn't spend resources unnecessarily changing the numbers.

### Progressive enhancement approach
Do you remember that debate at the beginning of the century about graceful degradation and progressive enhancement? It is still relevant to me.

If something goes wrong and your javascript does not load, your site or app still make sense.
